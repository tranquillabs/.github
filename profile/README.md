# Business Automation Toolchain

Set of tools to automate browser-based business workflows. Includes a browser, URL manager, layout manager, an SDK, and more.

> Our core principles are developer ergonomics, decoupled architecture, deterministic workflows, fast iteration loops, delightful user experience, no vendor lock in, incrementally adoptable, and open source.

Tranquil fits into your workflow without friction or added complexity, allowing you to focus on what matters most: **crafting high-impact deterministic business automations.**
